This library is a treasure trove of reusable components tailored for Jetpack Compose, designed to
simplify the creation of complex interfaces. It's your go-to toolkit for crafting visually stunning
UIs effortlessly. So, let's cut to the chase and unleash the magic! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Installation

To use the library, add the following line of code to your `build.gradle` file if you are using
Kotlin DSL:

```Kotlin
implementation("io.github.linx64:reusablecomponents:<version>")
```

Or this for Groovy:

```Groovy
implementation 'io.github.linx64:reusablecomponents:<version>'
```

Version Catalog:

```Kotlin-dsl
reusablecomponents_version = <version>
reusableComponents = { group = "io.github.linx64", name = "reusablecomponents", version.ref = "reuseableComponents" }
```

## Components

Currently, the library contains the following components:

- [Containers](https://github.com/LinX64/Reusable/tree/develop/reusablecomponents/src/main/kotlin/com/client/reusablecomponents/containers)
- [Buttons](https://github.com/LinX64/Reusable/tree/develop/reusablecomponents/src/main/kotlin/com/client/reusablecomponents/buttons)
- [Columns](https://github.com/LinX64/Reusable/blob/develop/reusablecomponents/src/main/kotlin/com/client/reusablecomponents/containers/CenteredColumn.kt)
- [Preview](https://github.com/LinX64/Reusable/tree/develop/reusablecomponents/src/main/kotlin/com/client/reusablecomponents/previews)
- [Spacers](https://github.com/LinX64/Reusable/tree/develop/reusablecomponents/src/main/kotlin/com/client/reusablecomponents/spacers)
- Other necessary components will be added soon.

## Usage

Using the components is very simple. Just add the library to your project and based on your need,
let's say you want to have a Scrollable screen with a few Buttons:

```kotlin
ScrollableScreen {
    PrimaryButton(text = R.string.app_name, onClick = {})
    Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))
}
```

And that's it! You have a scrollable screen with a few buttons. You can customize the container by
passing your own `modifier` to it. The same goes for the buttons, you can pass your own `modifier`
to it.

This is how it will look like:
